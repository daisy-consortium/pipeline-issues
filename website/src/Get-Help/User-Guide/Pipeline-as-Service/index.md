# Pipeline as a Service

Most people will use DAISY Pipeline 2 as a standalone desktop
application. It is easy to install and ready to go. But the Pipeline
can also be used as a service to which client programs can connect,
through a web API.

There are several use cases:

- You want to run batch jobs through a command line interface.
- You want to use our
  [web application]({{site.baseurl}}/wiki/webui/User-Guide/).
- You want to include the Pipeline in a larger setup where it needs to
  talk to other components.
