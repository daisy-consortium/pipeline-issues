## Background

The DAISY Pipeline is a collaborative project maintained by the
[DAISY Consortium](http://www.daisy.org/), with numerous organizations
participating and contributing to the development. The DAISY Pipeline
2 project is the follow-up of the
[DAISY Pipeline 1](http://www.daisy.org/pipeline) project. It consists
mostly in preparing for the future by redesigning the core Pipeline
framework to embrace new technologies and standards and better
integrate with the DAISY community and publishing mainstream.
