# Providing Error Logs in a GitHub Issue
## Find the Log Files
If an error message popped up when you tried to start DAISY Pipeline 2, then the log files should have been automatically opened with File Explorer.

If they weren't, open File Explorer and navigate to **%AppData%/Roaming/DAISY Pipeline 2/log**.
- *or* press **Win&#8862; + R**, copy/paste the path above, and hit **Enter**

## Provide the Log Files
1. Create a [GIST](https://gist.github.com).
2. Select all of your log files and drag them into the GIST.
3. Submit the GIST and provide the link in the appropriate section of your GitHub issue.

__NOTE__: Do __NOT__ paste the contents of your logs into the issue, as the issue will be much too long.
